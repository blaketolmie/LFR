## ATMega328P Microcontroller
[ATMega328P Datasheet](https://components101.com/microcontrollers/atmega328p-pinout-features-datasheet)  
[Pinout with ADC pins explained](https://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Atmega328-pinout.php#:~:text=Since%20the%20ADC%20for%20the%20Atmega328%20is%20a,value%3B%20thus%2C%20it%20is%20its%20digital%20correspondent%20value.)

>To burn a bootloader using AVR GCC, the choice of programmer depends on the hardware you have available for interfacing with the microcontroller.  
>Here’s a breakdown of the programmers listed in your image and their common uses:  
>  
>Arduino as ISP: If you have an Arduino board, you can use it to program AVR chips by setting it up as an ISP (In-System Programmer). This is a common and cost-effective method.  
>**USBasp:** This is a popular and inexpensive USB-based programmer for AVR microcontrollers. It's widely used and works well with AVR GCC.  
>**USBtinyISP:** Another inexpensive USB programmer. It’s often used with AVR microcontrollers but might be slower than USBasp.  
>**AVRISP mkII:** This is an official programmer from Atmel (now Microchip) designed for use with AVR microcontrollers. It is a reliable choice if you have access to it.  
>Clock: 9.216 MHz  

## Programming CHANGE TO ARDUINO PROGRAMMING SINCE EASIER / FASTER
[Arduino Programming](https://docs.arduino.cc/programming/)  
Serial.print(): Used to print data to the serial monitor without a newline.  
Serial.println(): Used to print data to the serial monitor with a newline.  
Serial.println("The value is: " + String(value));

### Pin macros
// Use PIN_PB5 macro to refer to pin PB5 (Arduino pin 13)  
digitalWrite(PIN_PB5, HIGH);

// Results in the exact same compiled code  
digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
