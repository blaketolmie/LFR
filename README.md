>**Arduino as ISP**: If you have an Arduino board, you can use it to program AVR chips by setting it up as an ISP (In-System Programmer). This is a common and cost-effective method.  
>USBasp: This is a popular and inexpensive USB-based programmer for AVR microcontrollers. It's widely used and works well with AVR GCC.  
>USBtinyISP: Another inexpensive USB programmer. It’s often used with AVR microcontrollers but might be slower than USBasp.  
>AVRISP mkII: This is an official programmer from Atmel (now Microchip) designed for use with AVR microcontrollers. It is a reliable choice if you have access to it.  
>Clock: 9.216 MHz
