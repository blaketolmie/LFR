## Access to Github
Send me your GitHub username or email so I can grant you collaborater access (so you can make push and pull requests etc)  
[GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)

## Set up  
Download [MiniCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MiniCore#how-to-install) and make sure its in the correct folder   
Open [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)  
Select Board - ATmega328 and port  
Go to tools and select preferences and burn bootloader  
>**Arduino as ISP**: If you have an Arduino board, you can use it to program AVR chips by setting it up as an ISP (In-System Programmer). This is a common and cost-effective method.  
>USBasp: This is a popular and inexpensive USB-based programmer for AVR microcontrollers. It's widely used and works well with AVR GCC.  
>USBtinyISP: Another inexpensive USB programmer. Itâ€™s often used with AVR microcontrollers but might be slower than USBasp.  
>AVRISP mkII: This is an official programmer from Atmel (now Microchip) designed for use with AVR microcontrollers. It is a reliable choice if you have access to it.  
>Clock: 9.216 MHz  
>[Arduino Programming](https://docs.arduino.cc/programming/)  
 
Can now use serial port  
  
## Arduino_Code
Incorporated  
- BANG BANG Controller     
- LEDs  
- Sensors  
- Motors  
- Config file - all #defines for pin and globals  
- Serial communication (println)  
  
NOTE:  
Only one reset button (MOTOR_CONTROL) is available since the RESET button is not connect to the microcontroller in the schematic.  
If sensors are giving random values - check the height from the ground
