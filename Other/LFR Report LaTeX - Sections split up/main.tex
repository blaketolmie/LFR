\begin{abstract}
This report presents the design, development, and performance analysis of a Line Following Robot (LFR), created as part of the ENMT221-24S2 term 4 project. The goal was to design a robot capable of autonomously navigating a course, following a black line on a white background, under strict design and time constraints. The process involved circuit and PCB design, mechanical prototyping, and microcontroller programming. Challenges encountered during the project included sensor board issues, requiring multiple adjustments and iterative design refinements. The final design demonstrated competitive performance, completing the course in 14.939 seconds and coming in $8^{th}$ place out of 36 teams. Despite successful results, further improvements in sensor integration and control algorithms, such as transitioning to PID control, are suggested to enhance the robot's tracking accuracy and speed. This project provided valuable hands-on experience with real-world testing, electronic design, and mechanical assembly.

\section{Introduction}
Automation is becoming increasingly prevalent in modern technology, especially with the rise of artificial intelligence and high labour costs. As mechatronics engineering students, it is important to have a strong understanding of the concepts surrounding this. For the term 4 project, we were tasked to design a line-following robot (commonly abbreviated as ‘LFR’) under the given constraints and limitations as specified by the project brief \cite{enmt221_lfr2024}. This process involves circuit design, PCB layout and manufacturing, mechanical design, and microcontroller programming. The aim was to design a robot that completes the provided course (black line on white background) in under 30 seconds. Line following robots have some real-world applications, such as the transportation of medical equipment in large hospitals \cite{kumaresan2017line}, and autonomous public transport \cite{gumus2016line}.

\section{Conclusion}
 The Line Following Robot project involved circuit design, PCB layout, mechanical assembly, and control systems. While we encountered challenges, particularly with sensor board malfunctions and feedback control, the robot still performed well, completing the course in 14.939 seconds. By using a reactive control system, we were able to achieve consistent results, though transitioning to a PID control system could improve accuracy and make the robot’s movements smoother. This project emphasized the importance of testing and collaboration to work through design unpredicted errors. Moving forward, further improvements could be made by refining sensor placement, improving the control system, and optimizing the mechanical design. Overall, the project met its objectives and gave us practical experience in combining different areas of mechatronics engineering.
