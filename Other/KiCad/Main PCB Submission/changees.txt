Made traces for capacitors and crystal oscillator thicker, removed 90 degree angles and odd edges.

Neaten the pcb, made sure traces are spaced evenly apart (reduce stray inductabce)

added more mounting holes just in case we need them

Added more test points at: AVcc TP5, microcontroller motor output TP4, voltage regulator Vin TP6.

Pin out configuration double checked - all correct!
